Unity
=====
Unity project is placed in /unity catalogue inside project. This is a project which is modified by Unity Editor. After modification of this project in Unity Editor there is a need to export this project as Android Project in Unity Editor. After that go to exported project folder and copy assets folder to app\src\main\assets in android project. Sometimes you should copy libraries from the libs folder to appropriate folder in android project and also .so files. But copying of them is only necessary if they have been changed.
